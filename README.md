The proposed Neuro-Fuzzy System (NFS), when integrated with RFECV for feature selection, outperforms recent models in nearly all evaluation metrics. Specifically:
Accuracy and F1-Score: The RFECV-NFS configuration achieves the highest accuracy (0.9500) and F1-score (0.9307), indicating strong overall predictive capability.
Recall: At 0.9318, the RFECV-NFS shows superior sensitivity, suggesting it is better at identifying diabetic patients correctly.
AUC-ROC: With an AUC-ROC of 0.9927, it has the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, outperforming models like SVM and Random Forest from recent studies.
Error Rate and FPR: The error rate and FPR are notably lower in the proposed system, improving reliability in healthcare diagnosis.
Thus, the proposed system not only demonstrates high accuracy but also maintains robustness across all critical performance metrics, making it a reliable tool for medical decision support in diabetes prediction.
